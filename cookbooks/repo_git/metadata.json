  "long_description": "= RightScale \"repo_git\" Provider\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nProvides the Git implementation of the 'repo' resource to\nmanage source code downloaded from Git repositories.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires the 'repo' Lightweight Resource cookbook\nhttps://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks/tree/master/cookbooks/repo . See \"repo\" cookbook README for details.\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* <tt>rightscale</tt>\n* <tt>repo</tt>\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Provider will be automatically initialized when you add \"repo:default\" recipe\n  to your ServerTemplate runlist\n\n* Once set up, use the recipes in the 'repo' cookbook to manage downloading from\n  your code repository. See the repo/README.rdoc for usage details.\n\n* Select the 'repo_git' option for the repo/default/provider input.\n\n* To perform correct operations, values for the repo/url and repo/branch inputs\n  must be provided.\n\n* To access private Git repositories, the repo/default/credential input must contain a\n  string with a valid Git SSH key or 'key'-type variable from the RightScale\n  dashboard.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\n\nThe 'repo_git' implementation can be called with the help of the Lightweight Resource, which can be\nfound in the <tt>repo</tt> cookbook.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please see\n{Lightweight Resources and Providers}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)].\n\n=== Attributes:\nnone\n\n=== Templates:\nnone\n\n=== Definitions:\nnone\n\n=== Libraries-helpers:\n\n<b>RightScale::Repo::SshKey.create(git_ssh_key)</b>\n\nCreate a bash script that provides the Git SSH key that is required to access code in private git repositories.\n\nParameters\n\n<tt>git_ssh_key(String)::</tt> Git private ssh key\n\nRaise\n\n<tt>RuntimeError::</tt> if the Git SSH key string is empty.\n\n<b>RightScale::Repo::SshKey.delete</b>\n\nRemove bash script created by the <tt>create</tt> method, after a successful pull operation.\n\nParameters\n\nnone\n\n=== LWRPs:\n\nThe <tt>repo_git</tt> provider is defined in the <tt>providers/default.rb</tt> file, which contains source code for <tt>:pull</tt> and <tt>:capistrano_pull</tt> actions.\nFor more info about these actions please see the <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.\n\nThe <tt>repo_git</tt> provider allows the retrieval of source code from remote Git repositories. It supports repositories with public and private (ssh key protected) access.\n\nFor normal operations, it requires the 'repo' resource, which acts as the interface to all <tt>repo_git</tt> provider logic.\n\n===== Actions:\n<tt>:pull</tt>\nStandard repository pull. Pull source code from a remote repository by specifying its location with a URL.\n\n<tt>:capistrano_pull</tt>\nPerform standard pull and then a capistrano deployment style will be applied.\n\n===== Usage Example:\n\nFor usage examples, please see the corresponding section in <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
