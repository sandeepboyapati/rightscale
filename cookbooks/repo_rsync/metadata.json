  "long_description": "= RightScale \"repo_rsync\" Provider\n\n== DESCRIPTION:\n\nProvides the rsync implementation of the 'repo' resource to\nmanage source code downloaded via rsync.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires the 'repo' Lightweight Resource cookbook\nhttps://github.com/rightscale/rightscale_cookbooks/tree/master/cookbooks/repo . See \"repo\" cookbook README for details.\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage.\n\n== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:\n\nPlease see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.\n\n* <tt>rightscale</tt>\n* <tt>repo</tt>\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\nThere are no known limitations.\n\n== SETUP/USAGE:\n\n* Provider will be automatically initialized when you add \"repo:default\" recipe\n  to your ServerTemplate runlist\n\n* Once set up, use the recipes in the 'repo' cookbook to manage downloading from\n  your code repository. See the repo/README.rdoc for usage details.\n\n* Select the 'repo_rsync' option for the repo/default/provider input.\n\n* To perform correct operations, values for the repo/url and others must be provided.\n\n* The repo/ssh_key input must contain a string with a valid SSH key or 'key'-type \n  variable from the RightScale dashboard.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\n\nThe 'repo_rsync' implementation can be called with the help of the Lightweight Resource, which can be\nfound in the <tt>repo</tt> cookbook.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please see\n{Lightweight Resources and Providers}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)].\n\n=== LWRPs:\n\nThe <tt>repo_rsync</tt> provider is defined in the <tt>providers/default.rb</tt> file, which contains source code for <tt>:pull</tt> and <tt>:capistrano_pull</tt> actions.\nFor more info about these actions please see the <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.\n\nThe <tt>repo_rsync</tt> provider allows the retrieval of source code via rsync.\n\nFor normal operations, it requires the 'repo' resource, which acts as the interface to all <tt>repo_rsync</tt> provider logic.\n\n===== Actions:\n<tt>:pull</tt>\nStandard repository pull. Pull source code from a remote repository by specifying its location with a URL.\n\n<tt>:capistrano_pull</tt>\nPerform standard pull and then a capistrano deployment style will be applied.\n\n===== Usage Example:\n\nFor usage examples, please see the corresponding section in <tt>repo</tt> cookbook's README.\n\n= LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
