= RightScale Database Manager for PostgreSQL (Beta)

== DESCRIPTION:

Provides the PostgreSQL implementation of the 'db' resource to install and
manage PostgreSQL database stand-alone servers and clients.


== DETAILS

The 'db' implementation is defined by a Lightweight Provider, which can be
found in the providers/default.rb file.


== REQUIREMENTS:

* Requires a VM launched from a RightScale managed RightImage

* Tested on CentOS 5.6 RightImage

* Supports PostgreSQL 9.1

* Needs RightScale ServerTemplate tools gem installed on system.


== COOKBOOKS DEPENDENCIES:

Please see <tt>metadata.rb</tt> file for the latest dependencies.

== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

There are no known limitations.


== SETUP:

* Place the <tt>db::default</tt> recipe into your runlist to set up the db resource.
  When using a RightScale ServerTemplate, it will automatically add the
  common database attributes to your ServerTemplate's inputs.

* Also, place the <tt>db_postgres::default</tt> recipe into your runlist to load the
  PostgreSQL provider, tuning parameters, as well as other PostgreSQL-specific
  attributes in as inputs.

== USAGE:

=== Basic usage
Once setup, use the recipes in the 'db' cookbook to install and manage your
PostgreSQL database servers and clients.  See the <tt>db/README.rdoc</tt> for usage
details.

Custom tuning parameters can be applied by overriding the <tt>postgres_tuning.rb</tt>
